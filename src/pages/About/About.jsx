            Student Marketplace was created to solve a real problem: university students
            need affordable supplies but existing marketplaces are full of scams and strangers.
            We built a platform where only verified students can trade — making campus commerce
            safe, simple, and trustworthy.

            Many students struggle with the cost of textbooks, electronics, and other school
            supplies. At the same time, graduating students have items they no longer need.
            Student Marketplace bridges this gap by creating a trusted space where students can
            help each other — buying and selling at fair prices, without the risk of dealing with
            anonymous sellers on public marketplaces. By requiring student verification, we ensure
            that every transaction is between real, accountable university students.
